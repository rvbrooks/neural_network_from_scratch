# neural_network_from_scratch

## About
In this repository I build a neural network (NN) from the ground up, following the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen (2019).

I use the NN to read digits from images of handwritten numbers (data from the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset).

I ended up using this knowledge in my work as a Fellow at S2DS, where I worked with Moirai Biodesign on a deep reinforcement learning problem.

This an important step in my self-learning and upskilling, through which I have developed a solid understanding of NN concepts including:
- Perceptrons
- Node architecture
- Backpropagation algorithm.
